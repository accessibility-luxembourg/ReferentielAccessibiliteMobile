*Version 1.0, published on 21 June 2021*

According to the [Luxembourg law of 28 May 2019](http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo), all websites and mobile applications of Luxembourg public sector bodies must be accessible. The [Information and Press Service](https://sip.gouvernement.lu/en.html) is responsible for checking their accessibility.

In this context, the framework for assessing the accessibility of mobile applications has been drawn up to serve as a basis for assessment and implementation for all public sector bodies in the scope of the law.

The RAAM provides an operational framework for checking compliance with accessibility requirements. It can therefore be used to check that a mobile application complies with the criteria described in the European standard [EN 301 549 v.3.2.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf) for the following sections: 

- 5 *Generic requirements*
- 6 *ICT with two-way voice communication*
- 7 *ICT with video capabilities*
- 10 *Non-web documents*
- 11 *Software*
- 12 *Documentation and support services*

It includes 107 control criteria. 

If the framework is not updated within 3 years to take into account new standards or technical specifications, it is possible to create your own tests in addition to the existing ones.
