- Where possible, criteria have been mapped to [APPT](https://appt.org/) documentation.
- For the criteria subject to the [non-interference principle](./methodologie.html#non-interference-principle), a note has been added.

#### Theme 2 “Colours”

- [Criterion 3.8](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-3-8): added a condition on the language of captions and a test for live synchronized media.
- [Criterion 3.14](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-3-14): improved the methodology and added an example.
- [Criteria 3.15](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-3-15) and [3.16](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-3-16): improvement of the methodology.
- [Criterion 3.17](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-3-17): revision of the wording of the criterion and improvement of the methodology.
- [Criterion 3.18](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-3-18): revision of the wording of the criterion, addition of conditions and improvement of the methodology.

#### Theme 11 “Consultation”

- [Criterion 11.7](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-11-7): modification of the condition "less than 3 per second" to "less than or equal to 3 per second".
- [Criterion 11.15](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-11-15): improvement of the methodology.

#### Theme 12 “Documentation and accessibility features”

- [Criterion 12.1](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-12-1): revision of the wording of the criterion and improvement of the methodology.
- [Criterion 12.2](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-12-2): revision of the wording of the criterion and improvement of the methodology.
- [Criterion 12.4](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-12-4): revision of the wording of the criterion (a note has been added to specify the scope of evaluation of the documentation) and addition of tests to cover each format.

#### Theme 13 “Editing tools”

- [Criterion 13.1](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-13-1): revision of the criterion wording and addition of tests to cover each format.
- [Criterion 13.2](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-13-2): revision of the criterion wording and improvement of the methodology.

Note: for criteria 13.1, 13.3 and 13.5, the methodologies have been revised to include the evaluation of content intended for publication in a mobile application. Although the corresponding criteria of the EN 301 549 standard (11.8.2 *Accessible content creation*{lang="en"} and 11.8.3 *Preservation of accessibility information in transformations*{lang="en"}) only target sections 9 (*Web content*{lang="en"}) and 10 (*Non-web content*{lang="en"}), and not section 11 (*Software*{lang="en"}, dedicated to the mobile context), it seemed essential to still include the evaluation of the elements targeted by these criteria if they appeared in a mobile application.

#### Theme 14 “Support services”

- [Criterion 14.1](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-14-1): revision of the wording of the criterion to better reflect what is evaluated.
- [Criterion 14.2](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-14-2): improvement of the methodology.
- [Criterion 14.3](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-14-3): new criterion. It was previously included in theme 12 “Documentation and accessibility features”. But for reasons of readability of the criteria and requirements, a criterion dedicated to the accessibility of the documentation of the assistance service has been created.

#### Theme 15 "Real-time communication"

- [Criterion 15.1](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-15-1): improvement of the methodology.
- [Criteria 15.1](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-15-1), [15.2](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-15-2), [15.6](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-15-6), [15.11](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-15-11): added to the methodology the statement “If the information cannot be found in the interface or its documentation, and the editor of the application is unable to answer about this technical characteristic, the criterion will be considered non-compliant.” 
- [Criterion 15.2](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-15-2): removed the condition relating to a terminal integrating a real-time written communication functionality. 
- [Criterion 15.3](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-15-3): improvement of the methodology.
- [Criterion 15.4](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-15-4): creation of 2 tests.

- [Criterion 15.9](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-15-9): revision of the wording of the criterion (the criterion contained a misinterpretation) and improvement of the methodology. Old criterion “_For each two-way voice communication application that provides caller identification, is there a way to present this identification for sign language users?_”; New criterion “_For each two-way voice communication application that makes it possible to identify the activity of a speaking interlocutor, it is possible to identify the activity of a signing interlocutor.
